# IoTNftInterfaceHubNext

## Description

This repository houses a framework for generating generative art NFTs using on-chain SVG rendering, optimized for gas efficiency through attribute-based compression and deterministic randomness derived from block hashes.

## Features

- Integrate MQTT protocol for low-bandwidth IoT device communication.
- Implement AES-256 encryption for secure data transmission between IoT devices and the hub.
- Utilize decentralized storage (IPFS) for NFT metadata to ensure immutability.
- Develop a RESTful API endpoint for querying NFT ownership and device status.
- Employ Solidity smart contracts for automated royalty distribution on NFT sales.
- Create a device management dashboard with remote firmware update capabilities.
- Implement anomaly detection algorithms using machine learning to identify malicious IoT device behavior.
- Support secure key management using hardware security modules (HSMs) for private key storage.
## Installation
